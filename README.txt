;--GLYPH MAKER--;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ver. 1.0

This program was made to create simple glyphs for AR projects. Users can specify a resolution for their glyph, and create their own custom designs. 

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;--HOW TO USE--;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Run the program. To the left is the Glyph grid, set to the default resolution of 5x5. even though the grid is 5x5, the outer rim is greyed out to ensure the final glyph does not touch the outer white border. 

Clicking on the enabled buttons in the grid toggles them between white and black. When save (保存） is pressed, an image of the glyph will be created that matches the grid, and will be saved in the smae directory as GlyphMaker with the name supplied by the user from the filename (ファイル名） inut field. File names are currently restricted to letters and numbers only. 

The resulution of the box can be chaged with the resolution (解像度） input field. enter a number (two digits only), and press the excecute (実行）　button to automatically reset and resize the grid.
